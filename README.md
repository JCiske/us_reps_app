# US-Reps-App

The purpose of this application was to show that I could use Kotlin and the Retrofit 2 Library.
It is very simplistic and is still a work in progress.  I will continue to build on this application in order to sharpen my skills.
 
API Source: https://whoismyrepresentative.com/

Assignment: 
	To implement open source API using Kotlin and Retrofit 2.
	Only implement a couple of the features in the API.
	
Future build:
	* Implement all features of the API in order to learn how to use multiple 
	lists(RecyclerView, CardView, etc) as well as performing multiple API calls
	through Retrofit 2.  
	 
	* Implement Material Design
	 
	* Support for multiple screens
	 
	* Passing data between fragments.
	 
	* Implement Dagger 2 Dependency Injection
	 
	* Caching of retrieved data
